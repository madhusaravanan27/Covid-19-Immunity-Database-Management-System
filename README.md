# **Covid-19-Immunity-Database-Management-System**

**Overview**:

The Patient Medical Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to help healthcare providers, clinics, and patients manage and track essential medical information. The system focuses on efficiently handling patient records, medical history, vaccination details, and clinic/doctor information, ensuring that healthcare services are delivered seamlessly. It also provides functionality for tracking COVID-19 exposure and testing details, enabling better decision-making and care for patients.

**Technologies Used**:

- **SQL**: SQL was used to design and create the relational database schema for managing patient, clinic, doctor, and medical records. Foreign key relationships and constraints were established to maintain data integrity and consistency.

- **Azure Data Studio**: Azure Data Studio was used for querying, managing, and maintaining the SQL database. It provided an intuitive interface for executing database scripts and managing patient-related data.

**Project Features**:
This project encompasses the creation of multiple tables and constraints to handle various entities involved in a healthcare system, including patients, clinics, doctors, and medical records. The database ensures that essential data like patient history, vaccination records, and COVID-19 testing results are properly stored and easily accessible.

**Key Components**:

**Patient Records Management**:

- Store and manage patient personal details (name, age, contact information).

- Track each patient's medical history, including existing conditions and surgeries.

**Clinic and Doctor Information:**

- Manage clinic details such as address, contact information, and associated doctors.

- Allow doctors to access patient records for better care delivery.

**Medical History and Vaccination Records:**

- Track medical histories, including vaccination information (COVID-related or others).

- Manage antibody testing results to track a patient's immunity status.

**COVID Exposure Tracking:**

- Record COVID exposure details such as infection date, severity, symptoms, and treatments.

**Constraints and Data Integrity:**

- Primary and foreign key constraints ensure that patient, doctor, and clinic records are consistently linked and maintained.

- Unique constraints ensure that duplicate records (e.g., email addresses) are not stored.

**Conclusion:**

The Patient Medical Management System provides a scalable and secure way to manage patient and clinic data, ensuring that both healthcare providers and patients have easy access to critical medical information. With the integration of SQL and Azure Data Studio, the system enables real-time updates, medical history tracking, and data-driven healthcare decisions.
